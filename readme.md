```
Dear Crater Community,

As we bring this chapter of Crater to a close, we want to express our deepest
gratitude for your unwavering support and contributions. Your dedication has been
the backbone of this project, and we couldn’t have come this far without you.

Over time, our focus shifted towards developing a business version of the Crater
API, which evolved into a distinct product. This transition brought about
compliance challenges that made it difficult to maintain the open-source version.
Despite our best efforts, the demands of the enterprise version and limited
resources have made it challenging to continue developing new features for the OSS
version.

In light of these challenges, we have decided to archive the Crater project. This
means there will be no further development, including security updates. However,
we are excited to announce that the future development of Crater will continue
under a new fork called InvoiceShelf. It's fully maintained by the community and
we believe this new direction will better serve the community and keep the spirit
of Crater alive. You can find the new project here: InvoiceShelf.

Thank you once again for being a part of this incredible journey. We look forward
to seeing the amazing things you will achieve with InvoiceShelf
https://github.com/InvoiceShelf/InvoiceShelf.

Warm regards,
The Crater Team
```

# fork: [InvoiceShelf](https://github.com/InvoiceShelf/InvoiceShelf)
The new fork of Crater is called InvoiceShelf, the transition should be smooth as they are picking up the development from the last Crater release, but please consolt documentation before making a migration.
